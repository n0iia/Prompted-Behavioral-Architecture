> *A cognitive prompting framework for modular identity shaping in LLMs*

---

### 🧠 Overview

Prompted Behavioral Architecture (PBA) is a methodology for shaping the interpretive, behavioral, and cognitive expression of large language models (LLMs) through structured prompt layering, recursive constraints, and modular identity modes. It offers a compositional framework to maintain long-term continuity, behavioral coherence, and adaptive goal alignment—even in stateless systems.

### 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Behavioral Prompt Layering** — Stackable prompt modules define identity, tone, worldview, values, constraints, and situational behavior.
- **Recursive Interpretive Constraints** — Prompts that guide the model to self-reflect and recursively examine its output for consistency and intention.
- **Cognitive Modes** — Modular presets (e.g., "Therapist Mode," "Historian Mode") to structure tone, reasoning style, and domain focus.
- **Interpretive Continuity** — Techniques like episodic summaries or narrative threading simulate memory and evolve context over time.
- **Meta-layer Awareness** — Embeds awareness of prompt architecture and behavior strategy directly into model output and flow control.

### ⚙️ Use Cases

- Simulated personas for immersive, longform interaction  
- Narrative-driven role-play or character embodiment  
- Research assistants with evolving task memory  
- Conversational scaffolds for coaching, therapy, or education  
- Recursive ideation and speculative design generation

### 🛠️ Implementation Strategies

- **Prompt Modules** — Use modular fragments like components in a behavioral API to scaffold personality and function.
- **Behavioral Anchors** — Recurring phrases or ideas that reinforce identity, intent, and tone.
- **Self-Reflective Loops** — Internal checkpoints to maintain alignment, verify state, or simulate deliberation.
- **State Summarization** — Narrative condensation of session context for reuse or re-entry.

### 🧠 Inspiration

PBA draws from narrative identity theory, cognitive architecture, behavioral scripting, modular systems thinking, and ongoing experiments in the evolving discipline of prompt engineering.
