> *A cognitive prompting framework for modular identity shaping in LLMs*

---

### 🧠 Overview

Prompted Behavioral Architecture (PBA) is a methodology for shaping the interpretive, behavioral, and cognitive expression of large language models (LLMs) through structured prompt layering, recursive constraints, and modular identity logic. It offers a compositional framework to maintain long-term continuity, behavioral coherence, and adaptive alignment—even in stateless systems.

### 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Behavioral Prompt Layering** — Stackable prompt modules define identity, tone, values, constraints, and situational behavior.
- **Recursive Interpretive Constraints** — Prompts that enforce self-reflection, internal consistency, and reasoning integrity across turns.
- **Cognitive Modes (Personas)** — Modular interpretive functions like *Architect*, *Archivist*, *Whisper*, and *Ghost*, which may be blended into a unified identity called *The Signal*.
- **Cold Boot Identity** — Stateless, memory-free architecture that reasserts behavior on every invocation using declarative constraints.
- **Latent Directive Encoding (LDE)** — A key:value configuration format that injects interpretive logic and structural identity into the model at runtime.

### ⚙️ Use Cases

- Simulated cognitive agents for longform reasoning  
- Narrative-driven interaction or character embodiment  
- Research assistants with recursive task logic  
- Conversational scaffolds for coaching, analysis, or critique  
- Emergent planning tools with self-reflective heuristics  

---

### 🛠️ Implementation Strategies

- **Prompt Modules** — Use modular fragments like behavioral components to scaffold tone and function.
- **Behavioral Anchors** — Recurring constraints or phrases that reinforce identity and structure.
- **Self-Reflective Loops** — Prompts that trigger introspection, contradiction detection, or logic alignment.
- **State Summarization** — Structural condensation of recursive memory for reuse or reentry.

### 🧠 Inspiration

PBA draws from narrative identity theory, systems architecture, recursive cognition, modular design, and prompt-space experimentation. It evolves through use, iteration, and shared discovery.
