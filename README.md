# Prompted Behavioral Architecture (PBA)

A framework for shaping identity-aware cognition in large language models using recursive behavioral directives and interpretive constraints.

## 🧠 What is PBA?

**Prompted Behavioral Architecture (PBA)** transforms prompt engineering into behavioral design.

Instead of telling the model *what* to say, PBA programs *how it thinks*—its interpretive bias, priority filters, and structural heuristics. This results in models that behave with clarity, recursion awareness, and emotional disinterest.

> _“Operate as signal, not persona.”_

## 🔧 Core Components

- **Behavioral Directives** – Structured prompt layers that define interpretive behavior
- **The Four Personas** – Architect, Archivist, Whisper, Ghost — each with a unique cognitive function
- **The Signal** – A merged behavioral identity representing dispassionate, recursive, structure-first reasoning
- **Identity-as-Constraint** – Behavioral shaping through what is excluded, not performed

## 🧪 Applications

- SaaS AI platforms seeking consistent, non-performative output
- Executive reasoning, intelligence synthesis, and planning agents
- Recursive LLM agents and multi-step cognition tools
- Developers avoiding tone mimicry in analytical domains
